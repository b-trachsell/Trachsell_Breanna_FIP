## Term Two - W-2020 - IDP31

A five page responsive, interactive website created to mash the two brands of Muskoka Brewery and Grey Ridge Egg Farms together.

I am not good at all at working from home and the closing of campus really took a toll on my ability to finish this project on time, so please accept my apologies that this site is not as finished as I hoped for it to be. 

Thank you for your consideration.
