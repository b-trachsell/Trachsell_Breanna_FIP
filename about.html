				It All Began In 2020 In Ridgetown Ontraio

			<div id="aboutParas">
				<p>Muskoka Brewery has a long standing tradition of making eye-catching, and unique beverage products, although most are alcoholic. Gary McMullen, company founder, noticed in a company quarterly meeting that statistics stated their products were mainly being consumed in the evening. He brought to the attention of his co-workers that there was a vast untapped market of people who drink things in the morning they have yet to market to. In a stroke of genius his co-founder The Ghost of Kirk Evans suggested that they sell eggs. He rationalized that eggs were a product that health conscious people like to consume in the morning. A majority of their consumers were people who lived for the great outdoors: they were people who were health conscious. So why not provide them with a healthy, alternative to their morning routines, they could take with them into the outdoors, but still with all of that Muskoka charm that they know and love?</p>

				<p>The product idea was set, but there was one minor problem. Muskoka Brewery was just that. A Brewery. They didn’t know the first thing about producing eggs. So they proceeded to do a little research. Early on they found the company Gray Ridge Egg Farms. The company was known for partnering with many other companies from Ontario egg farmers, to other egg brands. This tendency for partnership, and passion for their province of origin made them a perfect fit for this endeavour. A single call was made to Bill Gray himself and the deal was made. Gray Ridge was to provide eggs to Muskoka facilities where they would be packaged and sold as a healthy breakfast alternative.</p>

				<p>When the product began hitting the shelves, people were confused. Why are there beers in the egg aisle, and why are they selling eggs in the Beer Store? The two companies began to realise this was a terrible idea. “Who would want to drink eggs?” they thought to themselves. Almost immediately both companies started to lose sales. Bill Gray threatened to split the partnership if Muskoka didn’t figure something out to get people to buy the products. Gary thought of just accepting his fate and the termination of the deal, but Muskoka was a memorial to Kirk Evans. Gary couldn’t let down his business partner, or his weird ghost idea of putting eggs into bottles and selling them as a drink. He couldn’t let this product fail.</p>

				<p>The sole owner, and co-founder of Muskoka Brewery took to the streets. He decided to bring back the core of his company, community. He organised several breakfast events around Ontario, where people could get together, enjoy community, breakfast, and most importantly: Muskoka’s new egg line. The events went off without a hitch, thousands gathered to these breakfast events, enticed by promises of free food, and community. The amount of egg beverages consumed at these events outnumbered all of Muskoka’s previous sales. People couldn’t get enough of the stuff. They just hadn’t known it was what they needed in their lives until they were made to try it. Immediately after these events, Muskoka’s breakfast consumer consumption numbers sky-rocketed. The brands had been saved and the merger was safe.</p>

			 	<p>It is said that the ghost of Kirk Evans wept that day.</p>
